# Transfer of remaining vacation days

{% hint style="info" %}
The following tutorial applies to all organizations that keep track of employee vacation days using the HR module.
{% endhint %}

At the start of the year, vacation day remainders from the previous year need to be transferred to the current year for **all employees**. The Vecticum app enables users to view and control data on employee vacation day remainders through the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Reports window icon.png" alt="" data-size="line"> feature, that can be found in the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/HR module icon.png" alt="" data-size="line">module.

The app provides **two** types of **reports** for monitoring and controlling vacation day remainders:

1. <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Remaining vacation days report list item, unselected.png" alt="" data-size="line"> - shows the number of vacation days accumulated for the selected year.
2. <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Transfer of remaining vacation days Reports list item, unselected.png" alt="" data-size="line"> - shows the number of vacation days accumulated during the **previous year** and lets users transfer the remainder to the **ongoing year**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Transfer of remaining vacation days Reports list item, unselected.png" alt="" data-size="line"> report only sees vacation day data from **one** previous year - from 1st January to 31st December or the 12 month period until the indicated Anniversary date (if specified in the leave type: Annual leave). The report cannot be used to transfer vacation day remainders for periods older than one previous year. If vacation day remainders have not been properly transferred for periods older than one previous year, then the report will not properly transfer vacation day remainders to the ongoing year.

Vacation day remainders can only be transferred for the previous year, for example, vacation day remainders for 2021 can only be transferred after 2021-12-31 or after the indicated Anniversary date (if specified in the leave type: Annual leave).
{% endhint %}

Users that have the assigned roles: "Specialist (HR Core)", "Specialist (Absences)", "User (HR Core)" and "User (Absences)", have full access to the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Reports window icon.png" alt="" data-size="line"> feature. Instructions on how to view and transfer employee vacation days remaining from the previous year are presented in **chapter 1** of this tutorial. Instructions on how to view the report on employee vacation days accumulated in the selected year are presented in **chapter 2** of this tutorial.

If the task to transfer employee remaining vacation days needs to be delegated to another responsible person or persons, the employees have to be assigned the roles "Specialist (HR Core)", "Specialist (Absences)", "User (HR Core)" and "User (Absences)". The assignment can be done by an employee who has the role "Company contacts administrator". The assignment of role/security groups is outside of the scope of this tutorial.
